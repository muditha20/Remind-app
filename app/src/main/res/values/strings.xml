    <string name="help_text">The reminder app allows users to create and manage reminders for various tasks and events. When a user opens the app, they are presented with a main screen that displays a list of their current reminders. The app also allows users to edit and delete existing reminders by tapping on a reminder in the main screen list, which opens a screen where they can make changes or delete the reminder entirely.

If users need help or have any questions, they can email us at remnapp@gmail.com and we\'ll be happy to assist them.</string>
